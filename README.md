Exploring AlphaFold, RF Diffusion & 3D Protein Visualization

Project Overview
This project explores how AI is transforming protein science — from predicting natural protein structures using AlphaFold, to generating completely new protein designs using RF Diffusion.
The goal is to compare Experimental vs AlphaFold vs RF Diffusion protein structures and visualize them using ChimeraX and Blender for an interactive, demonstration.

Objective
1. Understand the traditional and AI-based approaches to protein structure determination.
2. Use AlphaFold (predictions) and RF Diffusion (designs) to study protein structures.
3. Visualize, compare, and animate 3D protein models.
4. Demonstrate how generative AI can create novel protein folds.
